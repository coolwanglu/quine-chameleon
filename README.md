# Quine Chameleon

A polymorphic program that transforms itself into different languages.

### Why

I'd like to learn new programming languages and I'm bored with Hello World's.

### Languages

### How to Play

*Dancing Chameleon*

`make dance` - Press `ctrl-c` to stop 

*Crawling Chameleon*

`make crawl` - Each step it outputs itself in a random language

### Dependencies
 
Python3 is required. While you need the other compilers/interpreters to run various output.  

Here's a quick install-all command for Ubuntu 15.04:

`sudo apt-get install clojure1.6 coffeescript emacs24-nox g++ gawk gcc gobjc golang-go lua5.2 mono-mcs nodejs openjdk-7-jdk perl6 python3 r-base racket ruby scala valac`

Note: Scala 2.9.2 does not work with Java 8

### Variants 

- `make ouroboros`: languages are went through in alphabetical order
- `make random-ouroboros`: languages are went through in a random order
- `make multiquines`: [Multiquines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_%28computing%29#Multiquines). The target language is specified through command-line. (See rules below)

### My Testing Environment

Ubuntu 15.04 with the following compilers/interpreters

- CoffeeScript 1.4.0
- GNU Awk 4.1.1
- GNU Emacs 24.4.1
- GCC 4.9.2
- Go 1.3.3
- Lua 5.2.3
- Mono 3.2.8
- Node.js 0.10.25
- OpenJDK 7
- Python 3.4.3
- R 3.1.2
- Rakudo 2014.07
- Racket 6.1
- Ruby 2.1.2
- Scala 2.9.2
- Vala 0.26.2

### Rules (beta)

- Source
  - No undefined behaviors
  - No compiler/interpreter warnings
  - As short as possible
  - The main class/module name must be `qc`, if required
- Behavior 
  - Random sequence should not remain the same
    * Set random seed when necessary
  - Use only standard libraries
  - No file operations
    * `#!/bin/cat` - Bash
  - No source inspections
    * `.toSource()` - JavaScript
  - No definition as compiler flags
    * `-D` for gcc, g++, valac
  - stdin is not closed
    * Use `BEGIN` instead of `END` in AWK
- Language
  - Use languages available to Ubuntu 15.04 
    * Or _easily_ obtainable
  - Use latest standard if not compatible
    * Python3 vs Python2
    * Perl6 vs Perl5
- Multiquines
  - A valid language suffix must be specified as the only command-line argument
    * Otherwise the behavior is undefined

### Naming Convention

For readability, here are some common variables names used, with exceptions:

- `A`: command line arguments 
- `I`: index of specified language (in the language array)
- `L`: data array by splitting `S`
- `P`: routine to output a string
- `S`: compact data string
